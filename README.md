## About

Baltic Explorer is a web-map application that is designed for collaborative maritime spatial
planning. With Baltic Explorer you can:

➢ Explore spatial data and maps of the Baltic Sea from multiple sources

➢ Draw and edit your own ideas and plans on a map

➢ Share your work with colleagues in multi-user workspaces

➢ Work locally or remotely on multiple devices

Baltic Explore uses uMap [umap-project](https://github.com/umap-project/) [django-leaflet-storage](https://github.com/umap-project/django-leaflet-storage) and [Leaflet.Storage](https://github.com/umap-project/Leaflet.Storage), built on top of Django and Leaflet.
